# Cyber Security Training Resources

# 13Cubed
[13Cubed](https://www.youtube.com/c/13cubed/playlists) produces tutorials on a variety of Cyber Security topics. His playlists are worth watching if you're interested in DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response).

# Antisyphontraining 
[Antisyphontraining](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/course-catalog/) was created by John Strand, a former SANS instructor who wanted to offer high-quality education to anyone, regardless of their financial position. They offer multiple `pay-what-you-can` training options over a vast number of topics. I'd recommend the `SOC Core Skills w/ John Strand` course to defenders who want an introduction to the Blue team. 

# HackTheBox 
Historically, I would always recommend that people just starting out in Cyber Security should save [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/) for when you actually have a basic understanding of offensive security concepts and understand how to apply some type of penetration testing methodolgy to actually solve the boxes on your own. Today, however my perspective has shifted as HTB is getting more and more accessible than ever. On their main platform, they have something called **Starting Point** that guides you through a series of basic machines to teach you the basics of penetration testing before you jump into the boot-to-root style boxes. They also recently released **HackTheBox Academy**, which offers gamified hands-on-learning similar to TryHackMe. The main difference between the two platforms from my experience is the depth that HTB goes into actually teaching you how things work. Understanding how things work and why something is vulnerable will provide more long-term value then understanding the step-by-step instructions to kick off a specific exploit. Exploits will change but the underlying technologies and patterns will often remain the same. Overall, HTB is a very good platform if your interested in offensive security or would like to round out your skills as an experienced blue teamer. 

# OverTheWire 
[OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) hosts a variety of wargames aimed at helping you learn cyber security concepts. If you would like to get more hands-on exposure to the Linux CLI than I highly recommend their Bandit challenge. Being comfortable with Linux can be considered a core skill in Cyber Security. You don't have to be a master, but understanding the basics will help you throughout your Cyber Security journey.

# Pico CTF 
[Pico CTF](https://www.picoctf.org/) is a free computer security education program with original content built on a CTF framework created by security and privacy experts at Carnegie Mellon University. Although the platform was created to help the university recruit potential students, the platform is open to everyone. It includes a challenges from a variety of domains and is a great introduction at Jeperdy style CTF challenges that are very common in the field. 

# SANS 
[SANS](https://www.sans.org/) is one of top resources for Cyber Security training, however due to the high cost associated with their programs. I would recommend that beginners build their foundations from elsewhere and save SANS for when you have a clear goal in mind and would like to learn about an advanced topic. The barrior of entry created by the high cost means that most SANS attendees have the course paid for by their employer as opposed to out of pocket. 

# SANS Holiday Hack 
A yearly holiday-themed CTF hosted by SANS. This CTF usually has a very balanced climb in difficulty, with challenges for all skill levels. Although the event is time-gated, they still host access to previous years challenges for you to practice your skills. 

# TryHackMe
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) is a hands-on learning resource that provides structured paths to reinforce your skills by providing guided, objective-based tasks and challenges. I highly recommend it to new and existing practitioners who want to get a solid foundation of core Cyber Security skills under their belt. Most of their trainings are free, however they do offer a low cost monthly subscription service that allows you to unlock everything. One of the things I enjoy most about their diverse catalog is the ability to learn things from both Blue team (Defenders) and Red teams (Attackers) perspective. In addtional to structured learning paths, they also have a lot of standalone CTF's challenges to test your skills.
